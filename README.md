## What is this Repository?
This repository contains code & data for a handwritten digit classifier. In this project, I will be utilizing the famous MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits. Furthermore, I will be building a neural network in PyTorch for this. My goal for this project is to get into the habit of building neural networks using PyTorch. In other words, this project serves as a fun proof of concept. Since I haven't used neural networks in an end-to-end project, I decided this would be a fun exercise for me to do. </br>
## Closing Remarks
This project was very enjoyable ,and I definitely learned a lot along the way! I would recommend this challenge to anyone who is looking to dive into Machine Learning & Data Science. It is quite simple, and the dataset is relatively small & not overwhelming. Overall, this challenge was really fun and a great learning experience!
