## What is this Repository?
This repository contains code & data for a handwritten digit classifier. In this project, I will be utilizing the famous MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits using a neural network built in PyTorch. This is a rather simple project; however my goal is not to build a full end-to-end application. My goal for this project is to get into the practice of building Artificial Neural Networks in PyTorch. Since I am reletively new to the area of deep learning, what better way to get better than to practice?! With that being said, this project is a fun proof of concept. Feel free to refer to it as much as you need; however, I advise you to tackle this challenge on your own. Like I said before, the best way to get better at deep learning is to to practice! </br>
